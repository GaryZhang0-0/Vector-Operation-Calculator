# Vector_Operation_Calculator
This is a neat project that helps do the basics of vector operations. This includes finding the magnitude or the unit vector, dotting and crossing vectors, finding projections and angles between vectors.
It's the first utility I made for my engineering classes, well, it has been a dirty work to do vector operations on vectors on assignments and my Ti-84 is really unser unfriendly. It's a very primitive program, with user interactions taking place in the console for most of the time, but it covers most of the operations and it's pretty light-weight. (so far as I know, these are the basic operations of 3D vectors) Please notice that using programs is sometimes considered as seeking unfair advantage and is not authorized.
This is the first time I try to upload something so hope you enjoy!
